Here\u2019s a step-by-step explanation of how blockchain operates:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blocks <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is a Block?<\/strong><br>Each block in a blockchain is similar to a page in a record book. It contains a list of transactions that have taken place. Think of it as a collection of details about various exchanges, such as who sent what to whom, and when.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contents of a Block<\/strong><br>Besides transaction details, each block includes a unique identifier called a hash. It also holds a reference to the hash of the previous block, which is crucial for creating a secure and connected chain of blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chain <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Linking Blocks<\/strong><br>Blocks are linked together to form a chain. Each new block contains a reference to the hash of the previous block, creating a continuous and unbroken chain. This linkage ensures that every block is securely connected to its predecessor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Integrity of the Chain<\/strong><br>Imagine a stack of books where each book refers to the last one. If you try to remove or alter a book in the middle, the entire stack\u2019s integrity is compromised. Similarly, in blockchain, if someone tries to change a block, it would require altering every subsequent block, which is nearly impossible due to the cryptographic security in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transaction<\/strong><br>The process begins when a user requests a transaction, such as sending Bitcoin to another person. This request initiates a series of steps to ensure the transaction is valid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verification<\/strong><br>The transaction request is sent to a network of computers known as nodes. These nodes work together to verify the transaction\u2019s details. They check whether the transaction is legitimate and whether the sender has enough funds to complete it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recording<\/strong><br>Once verified, the transaction is grouped with other transactions into a new block. This block is then prepared to be added to the blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Linking<\/strong><br>The new block is linked to the existing chain of blocks. Each block in the chain references the hash of the previous block, ensuring that the chain remains intact and secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why It Matters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security<\/strong><br>The linking process ensures that once a block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks. This makes blockchain highly secure, as any attempt to tamper with a block would require a tremendous amount of computational power to modify every block that follows it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparency<\/strong><br>All transactions recorded on the blockchain are visible to all participants in the network. This transparency allows anyone with access to the blockchain to view and verify transactions, promoting trust and accountability among users.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blockchain is a powerful technology that functions like a digital ledger, and understanding how it works can help appreciate its benefits.

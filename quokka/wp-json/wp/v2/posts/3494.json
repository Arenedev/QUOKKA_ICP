They are open to everyone, allowing anyone to view, interact with, and verify transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Decentralized<\/strong><br>No single authority controls a public blockchain. It operates much like a town hall meeting where everyone has a voice, and decisions are made collectively by all participants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Private Blockchain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Restricted Access<\/strong><br>A private blockchain is more like a private club\u2014only specific people or organizations can join. Access is restricted, and only authorized members can participate in the network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Controlled<\/strong><br>Unlike public blockchains, a private blockchain is managed by a single organization, similar to a company meeting where only employees are involved. This central control allows the organization to maintain oversight of the blockchain\u2019s operations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Differences<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Transparency<\/strong><br>Public blockchains are fully transparent, allowing everyone to see and verify transactions.
